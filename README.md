Honestly this repository will probably be changed or deleted because I have decided to pair-program for the startup.

But that's okay cause I will still have a repository to work with that my partner is hosting
This is a change from both



# Notes About What I Have Learned
- GitHub Assignment:  
    I am not totally new to GitHub but I have always struggled to totally understand it and how to use it. This time around I am dedicated to figuring it out. I learned a lot from this assignment by just diving in with some unimportant directories and using git and Github with them. I aim to learn a lot more

- Simon HTML:  
    I really enjoyed learning about how SVG's work. I played around with the coordinates to get a feel of how it all worked. I also did not know that you could include a tab icon in the head of an html document
