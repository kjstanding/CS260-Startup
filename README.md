# Welcome to my Startup

Honestly this repository will probably be changed or deleted because I have decided to pair-program for the startup.

But that's okay cause I will still have a repository to work with that my partner is hosting
This is a change from both



## Notes About What I Have Learned
### GitHub Assignment:  
I am not totally new to GitHub but I have always struggled to totally understand it and how to use it. This time around I am dedicated to figuring it out. I learned a lot from this assignment by just diving in with some unimportant directories and using git and Github with them. I aim to learn a lot more

### Simon HTML:  
I really enjoyed learning about how SVG's work. I played around with the coordinates to get a feel of how it all worked. I also did not know that you could include a tab icon in the head of an html document
    
### Simon JavaScript:  
I am most interested in storing data in the browser cache. I have been pondering how this was supposed to be done for our startup but its cool to learn how to store data in this way.
    
### Simon Service:  
It was really interesting to learn about Node and Express and how it can implement web services for an application. I recently coded a server in java that provides endpoints for an android application. It seems that JavaScript really is a much easier way to handle setting up APIs. The Service implementation of Simon seemed pretty straightforward and easy to understand
    
### Simon DB:  
I have a little experience with SQL databases from other classes. I really enjoy how easy it is to add to a mongoDB and have a JSON object be the same through almost the entire technology stack. It also is just so much easier to even access the DB vs a SQL DB.
    
### Simon Login:  
Again, I have learned a lot about authorization services from this lecture comparing to my experience in CS240 building a java server for an Android application. Interesting to learn that my browser is storing an authtoken for me when I login and thats why I am able to stay logged in accross different tabs and such.
    
### Simon Websocket:  
I really enjoyed learning about websocket. I didn't realize that peer to peer communication would be an issue so it was interesting to think through and realize our previous implementation would present issues in trying to create a chat service. Fun to learn about ping/pong and automatically keeping connections alive as well as sending the messages over the connection to other clients.
